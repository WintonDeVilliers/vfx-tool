# vfx-tool
This Python program aims to create directory structure(s) for vfx projects while avioding creation of unnecessary empty folders .
It does so by taking an existing project(s) structure and breaking it down into "building-blocks"
allowing the user to initialise only the folders they need at a particular point in time/ stage of production.
